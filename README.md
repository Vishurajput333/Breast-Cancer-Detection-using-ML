# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a **Flask web application** that predicts whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on cell nuclei measurements from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

The machine learning model was trained using `scikit-learn` and deployed in a simple web interface for user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **User-friendly Web Interface** built with Flask
- **Real-time Predictions** based on user input
- **Model trained** using real-world breast cancer dataset
- Displays a clear result: **"Cancer Detected"** or **"No Cancer Detected"**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Flask** – Web framework
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning model
- **Joblib** – Model serialization

📊 Input Features
The form requires 30 numerical inputs corresponding to:

Mean, Error, and Worst values of radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

These are derived from breast cancer cell nuclei measurements.
